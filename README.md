AIM/OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT: 
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their usage 
patterns and interactions with a subscription-based service. The model aims to help businesses retain 
customers by identifying those at high risk of leaving. 
 
INTRODUCTION: 
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. Identifying customers who are 
likely to stop using a service helps companies take early action and improve retention. This project 
focuses on building a Customer Churn Prediction system using a Decision Tree Classifier in Python. 
The system collects user input like gender, age, usage behavior, and support interaction, then predicts 
whether the customer is likely to churn. A simple and interactive Streamlit-based web app is 
developed to take inputs and display results, making the model accessible and easy to use. Visual 
comparisons with average customer data provide additional insights. 
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world business 
problems through a user-friendly interface.
